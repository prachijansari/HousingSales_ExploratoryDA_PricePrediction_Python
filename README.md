# HousingSales_ExploratoryDA_PricePrediction_Python
In this project, as part of IBM - Data Analysis with Python 
Business task was defined
## Working at a Real Estate Investment Trust they would like to start investing in Residential real estate. 
They would like to determine the market price of a house given a set of features. 
Analysis has to be done and have to predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.

Python is used for data-cleaning, analysing the data and creating the models for price prediction, evaluate and refine models. 

Major activities covered include:

Numerical representation of data using correlation, linear and polynomial regression, R-Squared values, etc
Graphical representation of data using boxplot, and seaborn's regplot.
Model refinement suing ridge regression object.
Polynomial transform of training and test data, etc.
